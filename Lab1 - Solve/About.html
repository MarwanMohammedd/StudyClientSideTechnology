                to reach this dream.
                but there is no happy or peace about this dream , I must be
                suffer and struggle to reach this dream.
                I must fight myself and make myself in control not my brain make
                me lazy or do what it is want to do!.
                So, I am happy to take this risk for joining <mark>ITI

                , to be useless , it is really bad feeling.
